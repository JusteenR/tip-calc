## Reflection

While I working at my internship at RBC for their Amplify Program as a developer I decided to make this side project. After following a the google basic tutorial to make a tip calculator I decided to make my own which focused more on object orientated programming concepts such as abstract classes and modularization.
My goals included using technologies learned up until this point about android app development and learning new skills while putting them into practice. This was a challenging experience since I am new to mobile app development. I was able to familiarize myself with best practices and learn many new things.
One of the main challenges was designing the code to be modularized/maintainable. I wanted to make sure I designed it so I could easily add more features into the app.
The technologies I implemented in this project are Kotlin and XML and I used Android Studio. In my next iteration I plan on allowing the user to choose the type of industry they are tipping at and alter the suggestions based on that.
